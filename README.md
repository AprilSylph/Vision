# About
_Vision_ was designed as a more desktop-oriented and internally much simpler version of the _Official_ Tumblr theme; its name is inspired by _Official_'s previous name, _Optica_.

As a result of being more desktop-focused, most elements of this theme are taken from the desktop Tumblr dashboard itself:
- Global Appearance sidebar (identical as possible to the on-dash blog hover previews)
- Dashboard-like posts (although taking some design elements from past dashboard layouts and [XKit](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit))
- Themed Posts from Tumblr Labs (when a background image is used)

This theme aims to be as data-efficient as possible, sending no data to the browser that it doesn't need.
It is also free of Javascript at its base - Tumblr adds scripts necessary for inter-blog interaction.
